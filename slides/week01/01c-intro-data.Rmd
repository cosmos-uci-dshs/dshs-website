## Data Frames 


```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

data(bad_drivers)
candy_rankings <- candy_rankings %>% 
  select(competitorname, chocolate, fruity, sugarpercent, pricepercent, winpercent)
```

[Dear Mona, Which State Has the Worst Drivers?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-state-has-the-worst-drivers/)

### Data Frame `bad_driver`  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/data-matrix.png')
knitr::include_graphics('img/data-matrix-tail.png')
```

---

## Data Frame `bad_driver`  

- The data frame has 8 __variables__ (`state`, `num_drivers`, `perc_speeding`, `perc_not_distracted`, `perc_no_previous`, `insurance_premiums`, `losses`). 

- The data frame has 51 __cases__. Each case represents a US state (or District of Columbia).

## Variables

Variables `n_kids` (number of kids), `height`, and `winpercent` are __numerical variables__. 

--

We can do certain analyses using these variables such as finding an average `winpercent` or the maximum or minimum `winpercent` meaningfully.

--

Not everything represented by numbers represents a numeric quantity. e.g. Student ID, cell phone number.

---

## Variables

Variables such as `chocolate`, `fruity`, and `class_year` (first-year, sophomore, junior, senior) are __categorical variables__. 

--

Categorical variables have __levels__. For instance `chocolate` and `fruity` both have two levels as `TRUE` and `FALSE` and `class_year` have four levels.

As a data scientist it is .font30[**your**] job to check the type(s) of data that you are working with. Do .font30[**not**]  assume you will work with clean data frames, with clean names, labels, and types.
