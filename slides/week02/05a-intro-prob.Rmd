## Introduction
 - We have used plots and summary statistics to learn about the distribution of variables and to investigate their relationships. 
 
 - We now want to generalize our findings to the population. 
 
 - However, we almost always remain uncertain about the true distributions and relationships in the population.
 
 - Therefore, when we generalize our findings from a sample to the whole population, we should explicitly specify the extent of our uncertainty.  
 
 - We now discuss probability as a measure of uncertainty.
 
 - We use some examples from genetics.
