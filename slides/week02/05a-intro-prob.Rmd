## Introduction
 - We have used plots and summary statistics to learn about the distribution of variables and to investigate their relationships. 
 
 - We now want to generalize our findings to the population. 
 
 - However, we almost always remain uncertain about the true distributions and relationships in the population.
 
 - Therefore, when we generalize our findings from a sample to the whole population, we should explicitly specify the extent of our uncertainty.  
 
 - We now discuss probability as a measure of uncertainty.
 
 - We use some examples from genetics.

## Some Commonly Used Genetic Terms
 
- Gene

- Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)

- Alleles

- Genotype

- Homozygous vs. heterozygous

- Phenotype

- Recessive vs. dominant

## Random phenomena and their sample space

- A phenomenon is called random if its outcome (value) cannot be determined with certainty before it occurs. 

- For example, coin tossing and genotypes  are random phenomena.

- The collection of all possible outcomes $S$ is called the sample space. 

  + Coin tossing: S=\{H, T\} 
  + Die rolling: S=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} 
  + Bi-allelic gene: S=\{A, a\} 
  + Genotype: S=\{AA, Aa, aa\}
