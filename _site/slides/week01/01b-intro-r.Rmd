## In Breakout Rooms

Each of you should  

- open RStudio.
- write the R code you have just seen.
- help each other with problems.
- ask TAs/instructors questions.
- keep RStudio open until the end of the session. We will get back to it.

## R is case-sensitive


```{r error=TRUE}

my_age <- 2020 - birth_year

My_age
```

If something comes in quotes, it is not defined in R. 


```{r}

ages <- c(25, my_age, 32)

names <- c("Menglin", "Mine", "Rafael")

data.frame(age = ages, name = names)
```

---


## Vocabulary

```{r eval=FALSE}
do(something)
```

`do()` is a function;   
`something` is the argument of the function.
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
do(something, colorful)
```

`do()` is a function;   
`something` is the first argument of the function;   
`colorful` is the second argument of the function.

## Getting Help

In order to get any help we can use `?` followed by function (or object) name. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
?c
```

After function names do not leave any spaces.

Before and after operators (e.g. <-, =) leave spaces. 

Put a space after a comma, **not** before. 

Object names are all lower case, with words separated by an underscore.

- No matter how good a data scientist is, they are prone to make errors when it comes to copying-pasting. 
- Another data scientist may not be able to replicate the same findings.

- We will adopt R Markdown, a tool that can support R as well as text (and images) simultaneously. 
- We can analyze data and communicate findings simultaneously within R Markdown.

## In Breakout Rooms

Each of you should:

- open RStudio.
- modify a R Markdown file as you have just seen.
- help each other with problems.
- ask TAs/instructors questions.

Discuss in groups:

How many panes did have we used in RStudio so far? What is the purpose of each pane?

## Fun Fact

Slides that you are currently looking at are also written in R Markdown. 
You can take a look at them [online](https://github.com/cosmos-uci-dshs/dshs-website/tree/main/slides).
By the end of this cluster you will learn how to make slides using R Markdown.

## R vs. RStudio

- You can write English (a language, so is R) words in a notebook (like RStudio).  
- But you can also write it elsewhere too (on a napkin, sand etc. or even in different notebooks).   
- R is a language that can be written in many different places, RStudio is just one of them.   
- There are many others.
